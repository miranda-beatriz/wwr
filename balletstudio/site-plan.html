      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will visit my site when they want to learn more about ballet and when they wish to start classes and become a ballerina.
        This site shows the studio's work, the time that each class is, and each grade, with the classes they could know where we are and how they can contact us via Instagram, Facebook, and telephone.
        I think that they would like to see the home page because I will give them a good experience for at the first view, sometimes the studios don´t give the whole information about prices and class times and the person needs to contact them to know more which it´s good and works but I know that it´s more simple and easy for both parts if all the information it´s easy and clean because no one loses time, so it´s something that will come to my favor and will attractive visitors because, at the home page, they will see all the information’s that they may have, but we give our contacts if they need to understand something or the information’s are not enough for that person.
        The questions that they will want to know are if they can take classes if the price is accessible for them if they could have some scholarship, also they will want to know what they need to do to start classes and if they can take a free class to see if they like it. Also, they would like to know something about the place and the teacher, and all these things they will find easily on the home page. 
        They would go to my site to find information and I think that it´s the principal activity that they will want to complete, but also I think that they will like to learn more about ballet because if they are on my site they are more interested to know about it. 
        The visitors will be more the people that live closer to the studio because someone in another state will not look for ballet classes there but I think that the two children's pages will bring visitors from another place because if they search for something about ballet history or benefits of ballet they will learn on my site, and because my site will be good to read and funny I believe that a lot of people will like to visit the site.

      </ul>
      <h3>Ballet History</h3>
      <p>
        On the second page, they can learn more about ballet, how ballet was created, and how ballet turned dance known in the world, we will give some important names and places that help with ballet history. 
        Another thing that they may like about my site is that it´s not usually a studio to teach a little about ballet history on they sites, In most cases, the person needs to look for books or a different site than the studio so I think it´s something that they would like.

      </ul>
      <h3>Beneficts of Ballet</h3>
      <p>
        The third page helps us to see the benefits which will show how can help our health, how ballet can help us to be more diligent, how can teach the person to become stronger, and all the things that can help a child and an adult that practices ballet.
        For the benefits of ballet for all ages it´s the same thing, you could find this information on a blog or some newspaper but if you are looking for a studio to learn ballet and find this information easily you can feel more confident, and some people looking for classes for a specific thing like lose weigh or lose shyness and if the studio gives you this information before you talk with they you will wish more make the classes.
