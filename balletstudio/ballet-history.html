        <h1>The history of ballet begins around 1500 in Italy. Terms like “ballet” and “ball” stem from the Italian word "ballare," which means "to dance."

            When Catherine de Medici of Italy married the French King Henry II, she introduced early dance styles into court life in France.</h1>
        <p> The official terminology and vocabulary of ballet was gradually codified in French over the next 100 years, and during the reign of Louis XIV, the king himself performed many of the popular dances of the time. Professional dancers were hired to perform at court functions after King Louis and fellow noblemen had stopped dancing. </p>
        <p>King Louis XIV helped to popularize and standardize the art form. A passionate dancer, he performed many roles himself, including that of the Sun King in Ballet de la nuit. His love of ballet fostered its elevation from a past time for amateurs to an endeavor requiring professional training.

            By 1661, a dance academy had opened in Paris, and in 1681 ballet moved from the courts to the stage. The French opera Le Triomphe de l’Amour incorporated ballet elements, creating a long-standing opera-ballet tradition in France. By the mid-1700s French ballet master Jean Georges Noverre rebelled against the artifice of opera-ballet, believing that ballet could stand on its own as an art form. His notions — that ballet should contain expressive, dramatic movement that should reveal the relationships between characters — introduced the ballet d’action, a dramatic style of ballet that conveys a narrative. Noverre’s work is considered the precursor to the narrative ballets of the 19th century.</p>

            <h1> Dancing en pointe (on toe) became popular during the early part of the nineteenth century, with women often performing in white, bell-like skirts that ended at the calf. Pointe dancing was reserved for women only, and this exclusive taste for female dancers and characters inspired a certain type of recognizable Romantic heroine - a sylph-like fairy whose pristine goodness and purity inevitably triumphs over evil or injustice. Italian ballerina Maria Taglioni was the first ballerina that we know of to dance on pointe in the early 1830s</h1>

                    Today, ballet takes many forms. Classical and romantic ballets are still performed to audiences around the world. At the same time, many ballet companies focus on innovative choreography and showcasing new movements with unique musical choices.

Modern ballet choreography emphasizes strength and athleticism, while still maintaining the traditional gracefulness and musicality. Famous ballets from centuries ago are still performed today to audiences across the world, as are new ballets that feature similar movements but with more modern music, costumes, and storylines.</p>
